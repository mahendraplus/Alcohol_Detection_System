## 📖 About

The Alcohol Detection System with Buzzer and Timestamp is a DIY project designed for detecting the presence of alcohol vapors in the air using an MQ alcohol sensor module and providing both an audible alert (buzzer) and a timestamp indicating when alcohol is detected. The system is implemented on an Arduino Uno microcontroller.

## ⭐️ Features

- 🍻 Alcohol detection using an MQ alcohol sensor module.
- 🔊 Audible alert via a buzzer when alcohol is detected.
- 🕒 Timestamp generation to record when alcohol is detected.
- 📈 Real-time monitoring of alcohol levels.
- 💡 Simple and cost-effective design for alcohol detection applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Wire Connections:**
   - Connect the MQ Alcohol Sensor:
     - VCC to 5V on Arduino.
     - GND to GND on Arduino.
     - AOUT to A0 on Arduino.
     - DOUT (not used in this project).
   - Connect the Buzzer:
     - Positive (longer leg) to a digital pin on Arduino (e.g., pin 8).
     - Negative (shorter leg) to GND on Arduino.

2. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino Uno.

3. Monitor the system through the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor or a compatible display.
